# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Ouroboros is an ARM64 (aarch64) operating system written in Rust (plus some
assembly where needed), still in its earliest stages. Design goals, taken
from `notes.txt` and `README.md`:

- Microkernel architecture
- POSIX-ish system calls
- Preemptive multitasking
- Filesystem choice still undecided (research needed; likely a simple FS first)
- Draws ideas from Linux, Minix, and Plan 9
- Primary test target is Parallels on Apple Silicon, not just an emulator

## Boot architecture (read this before touching boot/entry code)

The kernel builds directly as a UEFI application for the
`aarch64-unknown-uefi` target — there is no separate bootloader stage yet.
This is a deliberate choice, not a placeholder to "fix later" casually:
Parallels boots ARM VMs exclusively through UEFI firmware, with no
equivalent to QEMU's `-kernel` direct-boot shortcut, so UEFI is the only
boot path that works on both the fast QEMU dev loop and the real Parallels
test target. Don't reach for direct-kernel-boot conveniences (multiboot,
raw `-kernel` loading, etc.) without accounting for the fact that they won't
work on the Parallels target.

The `[[bin]]` in `kernel/Cargo.toml` is named `BOOTAA64` deliberately: UEFI
firmware auto-boots removable media at `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTAA64.EFI`, so the
build output can be staged straight into an ESP layout with no renaming step.

As the kernel outgrows what's reasonable to run under UEFI boot services,
expect a split into a thin UEFI bootloader stage that loads and hands off to
a separate kernel binary. That split hasn't happened yet.

## Commands

```sh
make build                  # cargo build (debug)
make build PROFILE=release  # release profile
make run                    # stage ESP dir + boot in QEMU (aarch64 virt machine, OVMF firmware)
make image                  # build esp.img, a FAT32 disk image for use as a Parallels boot disk
make clean
```

`make run` requires QEMU (`brew install qemu`, which also provides the
aarch64 OVMF firmware `make run` points at). `make image` requires macOS's
`hdiutil` (used to produce the FAT32 image).

There is no test suite yet — this is pre-alpha kernel code that only proves
it boots.

## Toolchain

Pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable channel, `aarch64-unknown-uefi`
target — installs automatically on first `cargo build`). The target ships
prebuilt `core`/`alloc` on stable, so no nightly toolchain or
`-Z build-std` is needed. `.cargo/config.toml` defaults the build target to
`aarch64-unknown-uefi`, so plain `cargo build`/`cargo clippy` at the repo
root already target the right platform.

## Structure

```
kernel/     the kernel itself, currently the entire UEFI application (src/main.rs is the #[entry] point)
```

Single-crate workspace for now (`Cargo.toml` at the root is a workspace with
one member). Expect this to grow into more crates as the bootloader/kernel
split happens and shared code (e.g. a syscall ABI crate) emerges.
